a major firmware version of 2, while an RB-530 has the same Product and Model IDs, but a major
version of 1. This information is exposed for a variety of reasons,such as setting up a GUI

Most devices will generate output on the serial port, and those devices have a map of their own
"ports" to help you make sense of what comes out of them. Each port object contains a string
for its name, its "number"(can also be a letter) and the number of lines it has. Aside from the
educational value, these things can help you set up a GUI. Some ports also contain a keyMap that
lets the library interpet what comes out of the device better. On some RBs it might not be
immediately clear which order the buttons go in, and the actual key presses reported make about
as much sense. That one's for internal use primarily, but it's exposed just in case. A lack of a
keyMap means that the library reports keys as they are given to it by the device.

Gathering responses from the pad has a few moving parts. You start by calling PollForResponse(), which
will pull some bytes from the buffer and attempt to parse them as a single response packet. If it
succeeds, it will store a processed response, and HasQueuedResponses() will now return true. You can then
retrieve a response from the queue at any time by calling GetNextResponse(). If you want to know whether
multiple keys are held down at once, GetNumberOfKeysDown() has you covered.

ClearResponsesFromBuffer() and ClearResponseQueue() respectively.
