## Documentation ##

There is currently no proper documentation for the library itself.

However, you can view the full list of XID2 commands here:
https://www.cedrus.com/support/xid/commands.htm

There are some m-pod specific commands on a separate page:
https://www.cedrus.com/support/xid/mpod_commands.htm

There is some additional helpful information for signal flow here:

## Examples ##

### Presentation Response Extension ###

The Visual Studio 2010 solution comes with our response extension for
[Presentation](http://www.neurobs.com/ "Presentation"). The code that
uses the xid_device_driver library to interact with Presentation is in
the CedrusXidDriver subfolder in the repository.

### C++ Code Example for Response Collection ###

    #include "XIDDeviceScanner.h"
    #include "XIDDevice.h"

    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
        Cedrus::XIDDeviceScanner & scanner = Cedrus::XIDDeviceScanner::GetDeviceScanner();

        scanner.DetectXIDDevices();

        std::shared_ptr<Cedrus::XIDDevice> device = scanner.DeviceConnectionAtIndex(0);

        std::cout << "Device found:\n" << device->GetInternalProductName() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "This program will close as soon as you press a button on the device.";

        while (true)
        {
            device->PollForResponse();

            if (device->HasQueuedResponses())
            {
                Cedrus::Response resp = device->GetNextResponse();
                // process response
                break;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }

### Python Code Example for Digital Output ###

    import time
    import pyxid2

    scanner = pyxid2.XIDDeviceScanner.GetDeviceScanner()

    print "Detecting XID devices, stand by..."
    scanner.DetectXIDDevices()

    devCount = scanner.DeviceCount()
    if (devCount == 0):
        print "No devices found."
        quit()

    devCon = scanner.DeviceConnectionAtIndex(0)
    print devCon.GetCombinedInfo()

    devCon.SetPulseDuration(500)
    linesBitmask = 1
    for bm in xrange (0, 8):
        devCon.RaiseLines(linesBitmask)
        linesBitmask = linesBitmask << 1
        time.sleep(.5)

    devCon.ClearLines()
